Tic Tac Toe
First Objective Before developement:
organize the developers tools for effecive work space
work on the game logic; come up with a framwork 


By writing functions that manipulate the the selectors for each box using
the game logic. I will be using callback functions and array itteration methods.


 I will first figure out the logic the game is based on and and try to
  break down the logical progression of how i would write the code for it. once
  i put that together, i will forcus on the other parts of the html and css design


As a game player i want access to the game bord convenient and secure

        .As a player i want the game bord to be functional and dynamic so i can
         enjoy the game uninterupted and get the rigth results

         . As a person who likes aestetics i want a visually pleasant
           interaction with the game because i enjoy playing it
         . As a person who appriciates simple directions, i want navigation
           between pages direct and i want the directions labled and allocated
           properly.
           
first i would separate, the html, css, and javascript in different files
        and then link them properly. I would separate javascript files modular
        as practices in class.
If possible, i would like to add a colorful congradulatory statement, or
        meme when a player wins.

 By adding and commiting changes i make to the project to the repo.
 I would add more interactive features to the page may be links to other
        pages, game reccomendations, and make the page more visually apealing

 Followed through the desired goals and suceeded in some and not others
 created the accounts and the developer tooles to create the gae:
 Had a general idea of how the game would be constructed.
 started with putting the the logic down and created a board
 and attempted to follow through the rest of the benchmarks 
 
 Future goals;
 
 complete the project in a way that can be played and produces complete functionality
 wok on the style 
 make it secure and durable
